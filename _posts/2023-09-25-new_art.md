I have commissioned my favorite artist [Kelci D Crawford](https://www.kelcidcrawford.com/) to make some art of my model.
Kelci is an amazin artist and you should definitely check them out.

Here is the first sketch showing three different pose options.
I'm going for the first one right now.
I will definitely be commissioning the other two later.
I'm so excited! ðŸ’œ
