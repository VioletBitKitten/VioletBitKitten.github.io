My favorite artist [Kelci](https://www.kelcidcrawford.com/) drew me. My very first commission. It's so cute!

The whole thing was [streamed on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AIzAfYgbCLU). It was a magcal process to see it go from sketch to complete image.

Go check out [Kelci](https://www.kelcidcrawford.com/). Their art is wonderful and they are amazing to work with.
