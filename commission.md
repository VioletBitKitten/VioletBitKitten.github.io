Details for VioletBitKitten commissions.

## Important points

A few specifics I care about:

* Violet is all about purple and violet.
* Violet has purple hair and her eyes are some shade of purple or violet.
* Violet is a cat person. She has fluffy ears and some sort of tail.
* Violet wears a colar. I prefer the collar Kelci created, it is similar to [this Eternity collar](https://www.eternitycollars.com/products/eternity-collar-gold). I'm open to new ideas.
* Violet wears glasses, she is a computer nerd after all.
* Violet has preportional size breasts. She isn't a giant boob-tuber. She also prefers a moderate amount of cleavage.
* Violet always wears a dress, always purple, violet or blue.

## Commission from Kelci

This is a commission Kelci did for me. I think of this as a more definitive version of Violet.
